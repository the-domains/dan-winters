Reading [How To Win Friends and Influence People ][0]is like rereading the cover letter of an essay just before you hand it in. You're pretty sure that you did everything, but when you check back it's clear that somewhere along the line, you and it lost touch. And you hope desperately that won't make much of a difference.

Like everybody, I like to think that I'm pretty okay at communications and handling people. I've worked in customer service before, I've worked in an office before, I've had people ask me to do something that I then did. I can do that. But when I think about the last six months or so, the evidence that I'm not as great is starting to build. 

Over the last six months I've had around ten interviews. And I've got exactly zero of those jobs. Whilst some of these failures are because I didn't exactly match what they wanted, such as not being able to work the standard hours of a bar or  preferring to work full or part-time as opposed to being an apprentice, it's unlikely that bad luck has played a part in all ten.

At some point along the line, I probably messed up a chance for a job that I could have got. And I want to make sure that never happens again. Which is why I'm reading _How To Win Friends and Influence People_.

Over the course of the next few weeks I'm going to read the entire book, and write something on each chapter. What I learnt from it, how I can adapt to it my life, and what we all should take from it. And what the hell 'communications' means when it comes to jobs, and how you can improve it.

I hope that it will be of some use to me, and I hope it will be some use to you too. Let's nail those interviews for once.
